  <body>Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Jorge and I'm 33 years old. I have been learning norwegian at voksen opplæring in Bodø and Stjørdal for almost 6 months. I have been working as a scaffolder for approximately 6 months in Bodø. But currently I am on sick leave and receiving parenting guidance from an organization called Aglo Familiesenter. I have a wife and two wonderful toddlers . Me and my wife are getting help from Aglo to help give a good life to our children and of course for ourselves to enjoy life. We are taking speical courses at Aglo to ensure the positive child development in our children. Me and my family will be living in Stjørdal until December 1. Then we will return to Bodø and continue raising our children.
