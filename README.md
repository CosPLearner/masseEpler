Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Jorge and I'm 33 years old and I am from the USA. I am married and have two small boys. We are currently living at Skatval. I have been learning norwegian at voksen opplæring in Bodø and Stjørdal for almost 6 months. I have been working as a scaffolder for approximately 6 months in Bodø. But currently I am on sick leave and receiving parenting guidance from an organization called Aglo Familiesenter. Me and my wife are getting special guidance from Aglo to make sure our children nourished with love and to make them feel safe.  Me and my family will be living in Skatval until December 1 and will return to Bodø then.
